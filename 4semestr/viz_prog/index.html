        Rags to Riches Animal Rescue Inc. Received a sweet surprise after <br> 
        taking in a Persian cat, Gerald. On July 24th, 2023, RTRARI made a post <br> 
        on Instagram with the caption "Apparently Gerald has been keeping a <br> 
        big secret from us! We were told make and neutered well... that's not the <br>
        case" And little wisp was born!
